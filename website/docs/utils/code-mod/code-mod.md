Migrations appeared in the components after major changes. To facilitate code updates and refactoring of your project, we have written **Codemod**-scripts.

**Codemod**-scripts make it easy to update your code to take advantage of new component features.

**Codemod** helps to get rid of a long search for files that need to be changed after a major update in the components.

**Codemod** starts functioning with the use of CLI commands.

## How to use in your project

- Run the script in the console with the command.

```bash
npx @semcore/code-mod
```

- Follow the prompts and select the configuration you need.
